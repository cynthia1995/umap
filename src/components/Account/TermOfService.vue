      </p>
      <h4>5. THE UMAP WALLET (OFFERED AND OPERATED BY UMAP).</h4>
      <p>
        <b>5.1 Supported Cryptocurrencies.</b>
        The UMAP wallet allows you to send, receive and store cryptocurrency (together, “Wallet Transactions”). The UMAP wallet is only available in relation to the
        cryptocurrencies that UMAP, in its sole discretion, decides to support (“Supported Cryptocurrency” or “Supported Cryptocurrencies”). Information about the Supported
        Cryptocurrencies can be found on the FAQ page on the UMAP website. The Supported Cryptocurrencies may change from time to time. Under no circumstances should you attempt to
        carry out a UMAP wallet Transaction in relation to a cryptocurrency other than a Supported Cryptocurrency.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>5.2 Transaction instructions.</b>
        UMAP will process Wallet Transactions according to your instructions. You accept and agree that UMAP does not:
      </p>
      <p>
        (a) guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, or other party to a UMAP Wallet Transaction. You are solely responsible for ensuring all transaction details are correct,
        and you should carefully verify all transaction information prior to submitting transaction instructions to UMAP; or
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) have any control over, or any liability in relation to, the delivery, quality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may buy from or sell to any third
        party. UMAP shall not be responsible for, and will take no action in relation to, ensuring that any buyer or seller you transact with using your UMAP wallet completes the
        relevant transaction or has the requisite authority to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>5.3 Receiving cryptocurrency.</b>
        You may receive Supported Cryptocurrency into your UMAP wallet by providing the sender with a receive address generated in your UMAP wallet. Your UMAP wallet will only be
        credited with Supported Cryptocurrency sent to a receive address generated through your UMAP wallet and associated with that Supported Cryptocurrency. For example, your
        UMAP wallet will be credited with ETH when it is sent to an ETH receive address generated through your UMAP wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>5.4 Fiat Currency P2P transactions.</b>
        UMAP allows you to use fiat currency funds solely in exchange for certain Supported Cryptocurrencies (like USDT) and with other UMAP Users in so-called “P2P transactions.”
        In a P2P transaction, UMAP holds the digital currency in escrow between the two counterparties until payment in fiat currency funds between the buyer and seller Users has
        been confirmed. Such Supported Cryptocurrency (e.g., USDT) is released as soon as payment is confirmed. UMAP does not take custody or facilitate transfer of the fiat
        currency funds in this model, and the transfer of the fiat currency funds is solely between Users without any responsibility or liability of UMAP in this connection.
        Without prejudice to the foregoing, you hereby grant UMAP the right to resolve issues and disputes among Users in its sole discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>5.5 Trading between Supported Cryptocurrencies.</b>
        UMAP allows you to trade with other Users between various Supported Cryptocurrencies (e.g., BTC-ETH, BTC-LTC etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>5.6 Sharing User Information.</b>
        In the course of processing a Wallet Transactions, UMAP may be required to share your user information with other contractual third parties, or as required under applicable
        laws or demanded upon a lawful request by any governmental authority. You hereby irrevocably grant full permission and authority for UMAP to share this information with
        such contractual third parties, or as required under applicable laws or demanded upon a lawful request by any governmental authority, and release UMAP from any liability,
        error, mistake, or negligence related thereto.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>5.7 Trade Corrections.</b>
        You acknowledge and agree that UMAP may correct, reverse or cancel, in its sole discretion, any order, trade, transfer, or other transaction or activity with respect to
        which UMAP has discovered  that there was an error or abnormality, whether such error or abnormality was caused by you, UMAP or a third party or due to technical issues,
        system issues, software failure or otherwise. UMAP provides no guarantee or warranty that any such attempt will be successful and will have no responsibility or liability
        for such error(s) or any correction attempt(s).
      </p>
      <h4>6. THE UMAP PAIRS (OFFERED AND OPERATED BY ZANMAI)</h4>
      <p>
        UMAP enables Users to trade with each other in trading pairs and use balances which are denominated notionally in Indian Rupees only for convenience in order to enable
        Users to calculate the value of the relevant Supported Cryptocurrency being traded (“UMAP Pairs”). Any reference to Indian Rupees or INR on UMAP should not be construed as
        a reference to Indian Rupees amounting to legal tender (otherwise referred to as ‘fiat currency’ or ‘real money’) unless specifically provided herein.
      </p>
      <p>While P2P transactions are offered and operated by UMAP (as described above), non-P2P transactions are offered and operated by Zanmai.</p>
      <p>
        Terms applicable to Indian Resident Users for UMAP Pairs  In non-P2P transactions, Users resident in India (as defined under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999) add
        to their INR balance by depositing Indian Rupees from their registered bank account / payment instrument to Zanmai’s or its partners’ bank account using regulated banking
        and payment channels, and can redeem their INR balance to their bank accounts / payment instrument by placing a withdrawal request to Zanmai, upon which request Zanmai will
        transfer the INR balance amount to the Users’ registered bank account / payment instrument, using regulated banking and payment channels, subject to Know Your Customer and
        other safeguards carried out in Zanmai’s sole discretion, and subject to withdrawal limits published on the website / mobile application from time to time. In this model,
        Zanmai merely acts as a duly appointed agent of the User to whom the payment is due, and does not operate a payment system. You hereby duly appoint Zanmai as your agent for
        this purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Terms applicable to Non-Indian Resident Users for UMAP Pairs  In all circumstances, Users not resident in India (as defined under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999)
        (“Foreign Users”) can use limited features of the Services. Foreign Users cannot in any circumstance receive or make payments in Indian Rupees or equivalents or any other
        fiat currency or equivalents (otherwise referred to as ‘real money’ or ‘fiat currency’). Foreign Users can only use the Services to trade between Supported Cryptocurrencies
        without any interface to fiat currency. Foreign Users are not entitled to redeem any INR balance with UMAP for Indian Rupees (unlike Users resident in India who may
        withdraw their INR balance to their bank accounts) or any other fiat currency. The INR balance of a Foreign User is only denoted on the platform for convenience and can
        only be used by a Foreign User to further trade in Supported Cryptocurrencies. Foreign Users do not therefore carry out any transactions in fiat currency using the Services
        and merely hold Supported Cryptocurrencies in their UMAP wallets and trade between Supported Cryptocurrencies.  This Clause 6 applies mutatis mutandis to the UMAP Pairs
        offered on UMAP.com and all UMAP desktop and mobile applications.
      </p>

        under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. You agree to first give us an opportunity to resolve any claims by contacting us on our website / mobile / desktop
        applications. If we are not able to resolve your claims within 60 days of receiving the notice, you may seek relief through arbitration or in the Small Claims Tribunals of
        Singapore (“SCT”), as set forth below.
        <br />
        Either you or UMAP may submit a dispute (after having made good faith efforts to resolve such dispute) for final and binding resolution by arbitration under the arbitration
        rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”), which are deemed to be incorporated into these Terms by reference. The arbitration tribunal shall consist
        of a sole arbitrator to be appointed by the President of SIAC. The language of the arbitration hearings shall be English and the seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall
        be Singapore. JUDGMENT ON ANY ARBITRAL AWARD MAY BE GIVEN IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTY (OR OVER THE ASSETS OF THE PARTY) AGAINST WHOM SUCH AN AWARD IS

        relief or other urgent equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. However, for the avoidance of doubt, where the claims fall outside of the jurisdiction of the
        SCT, the claims will be referred to and finally resolved by SIAC arbitration.

      <p>
        (h) Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a court of competent jurisdiction in order to
        maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration

        conditions set forth in this Agreement shall be binding upon assignees.
